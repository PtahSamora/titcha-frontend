# Study Room v2 - Quick Start Guide

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- All dependencies already installed
- Database has `roomPermissions` array (‚úÖ added)
- Socket.IO server running on port 3001

### 1. Start the Application

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Next.js dev server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Ensure Socket.IO is initialized
# It starts automatically when you access any page
```

### 2. Create Test Users (if needed)

You already have test users in dev_db.json:
- `test@student.com` (Test Student) - school-1
- `ssamoraam@gmail.com` (Vuyile Sixaba) - school-1
- `testing@gmail.com` (Samora) - school-1

### 3. Test the Room

#### A. Create a Room
1. Login as any student
2. Go to dashboard
3. Create a study room (existing feature)
4. Note the room ID in URL: `/portal/student/room/room-XXXXX`

#### B. Test Join Flow
1. **Same School (Success)**:
   - Open room URL
   - Should see loading ‚Üí then room with board + chat

2. **Cross School (Padlock)**:
   - Create user from different school
   - Try to join room
   - Should see üîí Access Restricted

3. **Invalid Room (Not Found)**:
   - Navigate to `/portal/student/room/invalid-id`
   - Should see üîç Room Not Found

#### C. Test Chat
1. Open room in two browser windows (different students)
2. Type message in one ‚Üí appears in both instantly
3. Try sending 11 messages quickly ‚Üí see rate limit toast

#### D. Test AI Permissions (Owner)
1. Login as room owner
2. Click kebab menu (‚ãÆ) in chat panel
3. Click "Disable Ask AI for all"
4. On other browser: Ask AI button should disable
5. Re-enable and verify button enables again

#### E. Test Ask AI
1. As owner or permitted member:
2. Type question in chat input
3. Click "ü§ñ Ask AI" button
4. Watch for:
   - System message in chat: "ü§ñ AI: ..."
   - AI blocks render on board as text elements
   - All members see the blocks

## üîç Debugging

### Check Logs
All room operations log to console in development:
```
[ROOM] Attempting to join room: room-XXX
[ROOM] Join successful: { roomId, userId }
[Socket.IO] Client connected: abc123
```

### Common Issues

#### 1. Padlock Shows Unexpectedly
- Check browser console for join response
- Verify both users have same schoolId
- Check API response status code

#### 2. Chat Messages Don't Appear
- Verify Socket.IO connection in Network tab
- Check socket server is running on port 3001
- Look for socket errors in console

#### 3. Ask AI Button Disabled
- Check permissions in chat panel header
- Verify you're a member or owner
- Check console for permission state

#### 4. AI Blocks Don't Render
- Check console for "AI blocks received" log
- Verify boardRef is initialized
- Check excalidrawAPI in Board component

## üìã API Testing with curl

### Join Room
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/rooms/room-1/join \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --cookie "next-auth.session-token=YOUR_SESSION"
```

### Get Permissions
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/rooms/room-1/permissions \
  --cookie "next-auth.session-token=YOUR_SESSION"
```

### Update Permissions (Owner)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/rooms/room-1/permissions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"askAiEnabled": false}' \
  --cookie "next-auth.session-token=YOUR_SESSION"
```

### Send Message
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/rooms/room-1/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello from API!"}' \
  --cookie "next-auth.session-token=YOUR_SESSION"
```

### Ask AI
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/rooms/room-1/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "What is calculus?"}' \
  --cookie "next-auth.session-token=YOUR_SESSION"
```

## üé® UI Components

### RoomLayout
Location: `/portal/student/room/[roomId]`
- Top bar with back button, room info, members, theme toggle, invite
- Grid layout: Board (left) + Chat (right 420px)
- Responsive: stacks vertically on mobile

### RoomChatPanel
- Header: Room name, member count, owner menu (‚ãÆ)
- Messages: Scrollable chat history
- Input: Text field + Send + Ask AI buttons
- Real-time updates via Socket.IO

### Board
- Excalidraw canvas
- Theme toggle: blackboard/whiteboard
- Imperative API: renderBlocks(), getScene()

---

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
Add to `.env.local`:
```bash
# Socket.IO URL (optional, defaults to localhost:3001)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

### Default Permissions
When a room is created, permissions default to:
```json
{
  "askAiEnabled": true,      // All members can ask AI
  "memberAskAi": []          // Empty = all allowed when enabled
}
```

To change defaults, edit `src/lib/devdb.ts` line 383:
```typescript
permissions = {
  roomId,
  askAiEnabled: false,  // Change to false for owner-only default
  memberAskAi: [],
  updatedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
};
```

## üì± Mobile Testing

### Responsive Breakpoints
- Desktop (lg): Board + Chat side-by-side
- Mobile (<lg): Board on top, Chat below (or hide one)

To test:
1. Open room on mobile device
2. Verify layout stacks vertically
3. Chat should be accessible and functional

---

## ‚ö° Performance Tips

### 1. Reduce Socket Events
If experiencing lag, increase throttle intervals:
- Chat: Currently no throttle, consider adding debounce
- AI: Rate limited to 5/minute
- Board sync: Already throttled at 200ms

### 2. Message Pagination
Currently loads all messages. For large rooms, add pagination:
```typescript
// In RoomChatPanel.tsx loadMessages()
const response = await fetch(
  `/api/rooms/${roomId}/messages?limit=50&before=${oldestMessageTime}`
);
```

### 3. Board Performance
For complex boards with many AI blocks:
- Limit blocks rendered per request (e.g., 5 max)
- Add button to "clear AI blocks"
- Implement virtual scrolling for chat

---

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Testing)
1. Add ToastProvider to root layout (if not already)
2. Verify socket server is running
3. Check dev_db.json has roomPermissions array

### Short Term
1. Implement permission management modal
2. Add autosave for board
3. Integrate real tutor API

### Long Term
1. Add file sharing to chat
2. Implement voice chat
3. Add screen sharing
4. Rich text AI blocks (math, code, images)

## üÜò Support

### Error Codes Reference
- `ROOM_NOT_FOUND`: Room doesn't exist ‚Üí Check room ID
- `CROSS_SCHOOL`: Different schools ‚Üí Verify schoolId match
- `NOT_MEMBER`: User not in room ‚Üí Rejoin with invite code
- `NOT_OWNER`: Non-owner tried admin action ‚Üí Must be owner
- `ASK_AI_DISABLED`: AI questions disabled ‚Üí Owner needs to enable
- `RATE_LIMIT`: Too many requests ‚Üí Wait and retry

### Debugging Checklist
- [ ] Check browser console for errors
- [ ] Verify Socket.IO connection (Network tab)
- [ ] Check API responses in Network tab
- [ ] Look for [ROOM] logs in server console
- [ ] Verify database has roomPermissions array
- [ ] Confirm same schoolId for both users
