## Security & Privacy

### School-Based Groups
- Members must be from same school
- Enforced at API level via `schoolId`
- Prevents cross-school interactions

### Member Verification
- Only registered users can be added
- Email verification required
- User must exist in database

### Rate Limiting
- **Group Messages**: 10 messages per 10 seconds per user
- Prevents spam and abuse
- Applies per group per user

### Authorization
- Only group members can:
  - View messages
  - Send messages
  - See member list
- Only group owner can:
  - Remove members (future feature)
  - Delete group (future feature)

## Common Issues & Solutions

### "User not found"
**Problem**: Email entered is not registered
**Solution**: User must register on Titcha first

### "Not a member of this group"
**Problem**: Trying to access group you're not in
**Solution**: Ask group owner to add you

### "Rate limit exceeded"
**Problem**: Sending too many messages too fast
**Solution**: Wait 10 seconds, then try again

### "Failed to create group"
**Problem**: Server error or invalid data
**Solutions**:
- Check group name is 3-60 characters
- Ensure you're logged in
- Check internet connection
- Try again in a moment

### Group not showing up
**Problem**: Group list not refreshing
**Solutions**:
- Refresh the page
- Check you're logged in as correct user
- Verify group was created successfully

## Best Practices

### Group Names
✅ **Good**: "Grade 8 Math Study Group", "Science Project Team", "English Homework Help"
❌ **Bad**: "ab", "x", "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"

### Study Room Subjects
✅ **Good**: "Mathematics", "Physical Sciences", "English", "History"
❌ **Bad**: "Stuff", "Things", "Whatever"

### Adding Members
✅ **Do**: Add classmates you study with, keep groups focused
❌ **Don't**: Add random people, create huge groups (hard to manage)

### Messaging
✅ **Do**: Stay on topic, be respectful, help each other learn
❌ **Don't**: Spam, share answers to tests, be disruptive

## Troubleshooting Commands (Developers)

### Check if user is in group:

const isMember = await isGroupMember(groupId, userId);
```

### Debug group messages:
```bash
# Check devdb.json
cat edu-ai-frontend/dev_db/dev_db.json | jq '.groupMessages'
```

### Reset group data (local development):
```bash
# Backup first!
cp dev_db/dev_db.json dev_db/dev_db.backup.json

# Edit dev_db.json to remove groups/messages
```

### Test group creation:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/groups/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: next-auth.session-token=YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"name":"Test Group"}'
```

## Conclusion

The group functionality is **fully functional** and ready to use. Students can:
- ✅ Create groups
- ✅ Add members
- ✅ Send messages
- ✅ Create study rooms
- ✅ Collaborate in real-time

All APIs are working, UI is complete, and the feature is production-ready!
